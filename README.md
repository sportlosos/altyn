# Welcome 

Here are a few Colab notebooks for daily routines:

## VideoeditorKukulin
A basic video editor developed for my friend who has no experience at all in the subject but wants to use short videos with subtitles in his lectures (lots of instructions!).

## Chunks. Whisper+GPT-3.5
My current little helper. At pragueschool.media, we host lots of public educational events, and Chunks helps us build our archive in various formats and two languages.

## Simple Whisper
It's the easiest onboarding to Colab ever, providing the brave experimenter with a free and secure tool to play.
